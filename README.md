# Ayroles Lab - Assorted Files

This repo contains a few of the files associated with things I worked on over the summer of 2018. There are more in other repos as well as locally, but I have put a few of the files here just as a bookkeeping measure. Note that very few files are in this repo and many of the more complete repos are linked in this README.

## Capillary Feeding Assay

### Design Files
Designed in AutoCAD - Only final design files are in this repo under FeedingAssay folder but the following folder contains many more intermittent designs that could prove useful.

### Associated Code
Written in MATLAB to segregate capillaries and track fluid movement. It relies on the assumption that a specific hue only exists on capillaries. The code is pretty easy to read and modify. I'd recommend looking through it and modifying thresholds as necessary before implementation. Of course, adjusting hue is necessary for any implementation and currently conversion from pixel to true length is not in this script; however, that should be trivial.
